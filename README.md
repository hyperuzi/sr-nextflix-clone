This is a netflix clone app I created during my spare time. 👾
The technologies I used are as follows - 
1. MongoDB : For storing Users (username, password[encrypted], searchHistory, image icons), Movies and TV Shows.
2. SpringBoot : As backend, with complete jwt token authencation flow for a logged in user, and APIs for Movies, TV Shows and History.
3. React : As frontend, integrated lucid-react icon and react-router-dom packages, with tailwindCSS for styling and zutstand for global state management.
4. Docker : Packaged React project as static files in SpringBoot and created a docker image to be deployed on render.com
